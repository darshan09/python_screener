# python_screener
This project is web based technical screener for candle stick patterns using TA-LIB, plotly and Flask.

To run the project
- Clone the repositiory
- run "FLASK-RUN" in main directory.

This project works well with indian stocks listed in NSE, Yahoo finance is used to fetch historical data.
to fetch data for indian stocks from yfinance, we need to pass stock symbol with'.NS'.
for eg- to ftech data of ACC we need to pass ACC.NS.

Code takes care of everything, in order to fetch USA stocks you do not need to pass stock symbol with '.NS'
